ToDo App (Skillfactory training project)

App uses local mock data to show some tasklists.
You can check tasks as completed.
You can add new tasklists using textarea (tasks must be separated by comma). Creation time is shown for new tasklists.



WIP: add new tasks as separate inputs for each (not textarea)
WIP: delete tasks
