ToDo App (Skillfactory training project)


App uses local mock data to show some task lists.

You can check tasks as completed.

You can add new task lists using multiple input fields. New task lists show creation date and time.

Unlike newly created task lists, the ones from mock data have no creation date.


Only class components were used (intentionally - for trainig purposes).


WiP: delete tasks
